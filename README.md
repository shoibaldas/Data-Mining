# Description

Three different datasets (Iris, Weather History, Contact Lense) are analyzed such as head(), describe(), info(), dropping dupplicate value, ensuring there is no missing value, also extracting data, dropping uneccessary numeric column and as well as mathematical caclutions were done with different kind of operations such as mean(average value), median(middle value). And, in contact lense dataset three different algorithms such as Decision Tree, K-Neighbours, and Neural Network were conducted and it showed three different results. Later, the results were analyzed with matplot to understand the difference more deeply.
